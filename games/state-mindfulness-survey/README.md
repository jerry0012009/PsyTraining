# State Mindfulness Scale (SMS)

This is an Experiment Survey that is friendly for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory). It was generated from the [tab separated file of questions](survey.tsv) and a [configuration file](config.json) using [this procedure](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/contribute#contribute-a-survey). 

You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions.

# Processing Data in R

There's an associated **alpha** `R` package for processing the data generated by the SMS.
This will happen in continuous integration, and you can run manually like this:

```
bash
cd expfactory.statemindfulnessscale
R -e 'devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'
R -e 'devtools::check()'
R -e 'devtools::test()'
```

## Installation

```
library(devtools)
install_github('expfactory-experiments/state-mindfulness-survey/expfactory.statemindfulnessscale')
```
