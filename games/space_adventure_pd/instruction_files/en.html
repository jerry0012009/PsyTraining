    <p>Welcome to the Space Adventure game!</p>
    <p>Today you will have the opportunity to take part in a journey through space.</p><br>
    <p>On your journey, you will be controlling a spaceship and visiting different planetary systems</p>
    <p>with the goal of collecting as many points as possible.</p><br>
    <p><strong>The more points you collect, the more money you will get for your participation!</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Before you start, the following tutorial will teach you everything you need to play the Space Adventure game,</p>
    <p>such as how to move the spaceship, how the planetary systems work and other game rules.</p>

    <p>In each game trial you will visit a new planetary system.</p><br><br>

    <p>In order to travel in space, you need to collect as much fuel as possible by flying from planet to planet.</p><br>
    <p>There are different types of planets (indicated by colour).</p><br>
    <p>Some planet types will give you fuel and others will make you lose fuel when you land on them.</p><br>
    
    <p>A blue bar at the top of the screen will show you the amount of fuel you have already gathered to help you keep track.</p>
    <p>You can see the fuel bar on the next intruction screen.</p><br><br>
    <p>The bar will turn red if you are running low on fuel</p>

    <p>There are two ways in which you can travel to different planets.</p><br>
    <p>You can either go <strong>one step in the clockwise direction</strong> by pressing the <strong>'M'-key</strong> on your keyboard</p><br>

    <p>or you can reach <strong>more distant planets</strong> (i.e. a not directly adjacent planet) by pressing the <strong>'Y'-key.</strong></p>

    <p>you cannot reach just any planet, but only a specific planet.</p><br>
    <p>You can now try out what happens at each starting position</p>
    <p>when you select 'jump' ('Y'-key) and which planet you can jump to.</p><br>
    <p>Please memorise exactly which planets you can jump to from each starting position.</p>

<div id="jump-uncertainty-2" class="text-aligned inactive">
    <p>Important note: In the actual experiment, which begins after this tutorial,</p>
    <p>it can sometimes happen that your jump is unreliable.</p>
    <p>In such cases, the spaceship misses the target planet</p>
    <p>and lands on one of the two planets directly adjacent (left and right) to the target planet instead.</p>

</div>

<div id="jump-uncertainty-4" class="text-aligned inactive">
    <p>In some planetary systems you will encounter asteroids.</p>
    <p>In such systems it happens particularly often that you miss the target planet during a jump.</p>
    <p>In planetary systems without asteroids, this happens much less frequently in comparison.</p>
    <p>You can always tell whether you are in a planetary system with asteroids by the background image.</p>
    <img src="src/planets_asteroid.png" alt="", class="img-instr-small">
    <p>To give you a feel for this, you can now try out the jump in both conditions (with and without asteroids).</p>
    <p>Please note that the already known jump pattern from the start planet to the target planet remains the same,</p>
    <p>but becomes less reliable.</p><br>
    <p>Please press the right arrow key to start the training or the left arrow key to go back one page.</p>

<div id="jump-uncertainty-5" class="text-aligned inactive">
    <p>You are now starting the following training in planetary systems without asteroids:</p><br><br>
    <p>If you choose to jump, you will almost always land on the expected target planet.</p>
    <p>Please try the 'jump' command a few times by repeatedly pressing the 'Y'-key in the next instruction screen.</p><br><br><br>

<div id="jump-uncertainty-6" class="text-aligned inactive">
    <p>Now you will practice the 'jump' command in planetary systems with asteroids.</p><br>
    <p>In this condition, the 'jump' command is highly unreliable and you will miss the target planet quite often.</p>
    <p>To give you a feel for this, you can now try out the 'jump' command a few times</p>
    <p>by repeatedly pressing the 'Y'-key.</p><br>
    <p>Note that the familiar jump pattern from the start planet to the target planet remains the same,</p>
    <p>but it is much more likely that you will miss the target planet.</p> 
    <p><strong>Be aware that the chance of missing the target planet in the respective conditions (with or without asteroids) does not change throughout the game.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>This means that in planetary systems without asteroids, a jump ('Y'-key) is always more reliable to the same extent.</p>
    <p>In the condition with asteroids it is always less reliable to the same extent.</p> 
    <p>Flying clockwise ('M'-key), on the other hand, is always reliable.</p>

    <p>You just learned how to to navigate to different planets under the two travelling conditions (with and without asteroids).</p>

    <p>You can gain fuel by landing on certain types of planets.</p>
    <p>Other types of planets will make you lose fuel when you land on them.</p>
    <p>Whether you win or lose fuel and how much you win or lose therefore depends on which planet you land on.</p>
    <!-- <p>Whether and how much fuel you receive or lose therefore depends on which target planet you land on.</p> -->
    <p>In order to be able to travel, it is important that you try to collect as much fuel as possible.</p><br><br>

<div id="summary" class="inactive text-aligned">
    <p>To summarise:</p><br>
    <p>Your task is to collect as much fuel as possible by travelling from planet to planet.</p>
    <p>You can travel either one step in the clockwise direction ('M'-key) or jump to a more distant planet ('Y'-key) following the jump pattern.</p>
    <p>Different planet types can either bring you fuel or make you lose fuel.</p>
    <p>The bar at the top of the screen shows you how much fuel you currently have.</p>
    <p>When you jump, it sometimes happens that you land on the left or right neighbouring planet </p>
    <p>instead of the expected target planet. This happens particularly frequently in planetary systems with asteroids in the background,</p>
    <p>but can also (rarely) happen in planetary systems without asteroids. </p>
    <p>The different probabilities of how often you miss the target planet</p>
    <p>remain the same within the respective condition (i.e. with and without asteroids) during the entire experiment.</p><br>

<div id="tip-1" class="text-aligned inactive">
    <p>One important tip:</p>
    <p>It will help you a lot in the task if you plan all 3 of your travel steps in advance.</p>

<div id="tip-2" class="text-aligned inactive">
    <p>Imagine you start in the planet constellation given below and you need to make two more moves. 
    <br>If you only planned one move in advance, you would probably jump directly to the blue planet.
    <br>However, then you would be forced to travel to one of the red planets.</p>
    <img src="src/Tipp_1.jpg" alt="" class="img-instr">
    <p>In total you would lose 10 points. (+10 -20)
    <br>In this example it is assumed that you will always land on the target planet during a jump for simplicity.</p>

<div id="tip-3" class="text-aligned inactive">
    <p>So, in this planetary system it would have been better to lose a smaller amount of fuel first</p>
    <p>and travel to the blue planet afterwards.</p>
